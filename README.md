## What are we trying to accomplish?
<b> TL;DR: </b> Identify / create an opensource framework that allows scalable and secure mesh networks. There are numerous existing frameworks that support adhoc networking, and our goal is primarily to find a solution. We will therefore make use of open-source implementations as much as possible. Because we're trying to make this technology accessible to a wide spectrum of people, we will need cross-platform compatibility.
